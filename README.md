Program is incomplete

Program works with two classes, a Point Class and a Cluster Class.

default amount of dimensions is 3
the program does prompt the user for a numebr, however. 

Point Class:
member data is dim, for dimensions number, and coor[], a dynamic array of doubles the size of dim



Point constructors:
no default, there is a constructor that takes in an int and 3 doubles so you can create your points custom, 
there is a constructor that takes in only an int that initializes the array size to that int and generates
random numbers for you.
There is also a constructor that takes in a double array and initializes a new point to the information in that array.

// copy constructor
Point::Point(const Point &copied)
copies information of on point to the other

Point functions:
double distanceTo(const Point &)
calculates the distance between two points, using euclidean math.

double getCoor(int i) {return coor[i];}

friend functions:

        friend bool operator==(const Point &a, const Point &b);

        friend bool operator!=(const Point &a, const Point &b);

        friend bool operator<(const Point &a, const Point &b);

        friend bool operator>(const Point &a, const Point &b);

        friend const Point operator+(const Point &, const Point &);
        friend Point operator+=(Point &, const Point &);

        friend const Point operator-(const Point&, const Point &);
        friend Point operator-=(Point &, const Point &);


        friend std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &, const Point &);
        
Cluster Class
The class contains a linked list, each node in the list points to a point, as well as another node or nullptr
if it's the last one.
The member data is points, the head of the list, and size, the size of list.



        default constructor
        Cluster() : size(0), points(nullptr) {};
   
        // The big three: cpy ctor, overloaded operator=, dtor
        Cluster(const Cluster &);
        constructor takes a cluster reference and initializes a new cluster with the referenced cluster
        
        Cluster &operator=(const Cluster &);
        constructor assigns information to calling cluster gathered from a referenced cluster
        
        ~Cluster();
        destructor, deletes all point pointers in the linked list, and also the nodes in the linked list. 
        

        // Set functions: They allow calling c1.add(c2.remove(p));
        // take point out of c2 and give to c1
        void add(const PointPtr &pnt);
        will add a new point to an existing cluster, in lexicographical order of the point dimensions
        

        // const PointPtr &remove(const PointPtr &);
        // Overloaded operators

        // IO
        friend std::ostream &operator<<(std::ostream &, const Cluster &);/*
        friend std::istream &operator>>(std::istream &, Cluster &);

        // Set-preserving operators (do not duplicate points in the space)
        // - Friends
        friend bool operator==(const Cluster &lhs, const Cluster &rhs);

        // - Members
        Cluster &operator+=(const Cluster &rhs); // union
        Cluster &operator-=(const Cluster &rhs); // (asymmetric) difference

        Cluster &operator+=(const Point &rhs); // add point
        Cluster &operator-=(const Point &rhs); // remove point

        // Set-destructive operators (duplicate points in the space)
        // - Friends
        friend const Cluster operator+(const Cluster &lhs, const Cluster &rhs);
        friend const Cluster operator-(const Cluster &lhs, const Cluster &rhs);

        friend const Cluster operator+(const Cluster &lhs, const PointPtr &rhs);
        friend const Cluster operator-(const Cluster &lhs, const PointPtr &rhs);
